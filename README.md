# SnakeS
## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Tkinter. The game consists of a snake that moves around a grid and tries to eat food, thus increasing its length. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible score by navigating the snake without colliding with the walls or its own body.

## Features

The Snake Game project includes the following features:

- Snake movement: The snake can move up, down, left, or right based on user input.
- Food generation: The game generates food at random locations on the grid.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed.
- Collision detection: The game checks for collisions between the snake's head, its body parts, and the walls, triggering a game over if a collision occurs.

## Installation and Usage

To run the Snake Game project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game by executing the command `python main.py`.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself. The game will display the score. 

## Improvements to Make
1. Add a database of highscores
2. Ability to restart the game after collisions
